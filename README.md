Descriptive and Predictive Analytics for Customer Behaviour, Pricing and Sales Performance Using Machine Learning to Gain Insights for Classic Models

This project uses descriptive and predictive analytics to analyse customer behaviour, pricing strategies, and sales performance for Classic Models, a business specializing in high-quality miniature replicas. Using machine learning techniques, the study generates actionable insights to support data-driven decision-making and foster sustainable growth in a competitive market. Descriptive analytics revealed key sales metrics, including average customer spend, top-selling products, and revenue trends, while identifying seasonal patterns and high-value customers. Employee and office performance were also assessed, highlighting sales contributions and operational efficiencies. Predictive analytics leveraged RFM modelling and clustering to segment customers and predict lifetime value (LTV), enabling targeted marketing strategies. Pricing optimization through regression models provided recommendations for adjusting underperforming and overperforming products to maximize revenue, while ARIMA time series forecasting predicted seasonal sales trends to inform inventory and resource planning. Topic modelling using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) analysed customer feedback, uncovering themes like product quality, shipping concerns, and payment clarity, with actionable recommendations to enhance customer satisfaction. By integrating these insights, Classic Models can optimize marketing, operations, and decision-making, achieving a competitive edge and long-term success.
